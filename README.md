# Synesthesia

## Synesthesia is a cute musical game. The objective of the game is to match the color of the shapes
to score bonus points, while moving in a musically designed level.

For the competition only one level could be made, but all the level design tools are done so more
songs are expected to be added.

## Running the game
You'll need a simple server for running the game, a simple `python -m HTTSimpleServer` is enough.
Open the index.html file to start playing
The game was only tested in Chrome, sorry :(

## Controls

Up and down for moving. Right for dashing. Left for *changing* color.

## Songs

Nothing to Fear - Dexter Britain. https://soundcloud.com/dexterbritain/nothing-to-fear (CC)

## Libraries
Technologies and libraries used:
SoundJS http://www.createjs.com/#!/SoundJS
Neon Js https://github.com/azendal/neon
Chameleon https://github.com/sgarza/Chameleon

## Future development

Levels can be created as json or javascript files, so more songs are in the progress!
